Run the book.py file for the bookin slots after jsut opening but you need to know how to bypass the Store ops vpn detection.. otherwise your not be able to capture the api requests and more importantly the AUTH_TOKEN is required to perform any task a token only valid for 24hrs after you login to id ... 

for changing any variables use the setting.py file 

if you want break the during slots use the master.py progrma actual do that break your if (offline) and instanly online and the also push you to the last line the script running on loop until you stop 


WARNING  : THIS IS NOT A OFFICIAL TOOL IT JUST MADE FOR MY OWN PURPOSE BUT I DECIDED TO SHARE 
PLESE DO NOT HARM AND ITS INCLUDED THEIR PRIVATE APIS....  

THE PURPOSE OF MADING THIS SCRIPT IS WHEN THE SLOTS OPEN FOR OUR STORE I AM UNABLE BOOK ANY SLOTS BECAUSE OF THE 5G INTRNET AND THEIR FAST PHONES,, SO I MADE THIS BY INTERCEPTING THEIR STORE OPS APPLICATION API CALLS ... 

DONT BOOK ANY SLOTS ON THIS STORE ID : 5296 AS KNOWN AS SITE ID
